> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-sudo-application from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-sudo-application
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo sudo-application
```

### Dependencies

- yo (for sure)
- git

### Sudo-Application:app

This generator creates the structure of a typically project.
It enables you to start a new project and optinally use EMIL and UDO to start your development.

If you choose one of these subcomponents, the generator also starts the setup of each subcomponent.

All you have to do is to type "yo sudo-application:app" and answer the questions on the screen.


The result is a ready-to-use environment for you application.

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
